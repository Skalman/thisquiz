//! Play-time validity: is an answer to question `qi` valid / pending / invalid on
//! the current (possibly partial) board? `check_claim` is the single authority the
//! solver, generator, and UI all share.
//!
//! Scope — *one question against the raw marks*. This checks a single question's
//! own constraint against the board's answers + eliminations. It reads every cell's
//! mark (CountVowel tallies the whole board), but it never interprets another
//! *question's* meaning: combining two questions — e.g. bounding a letter from a
//! sibling `CountAnswer` — is cross-question reasoning, which is deduce's job.
//! check_answer sees such a consequence only once deduce has propagated it into the
//! marks (forced/eliminated cells), never by reading the other question's type.
//!
//! Within that scope it aims to be *complete* — unlike `deduce` (deliberately
//! incomplete, see its module doc). The scope is bounded, so a definite verdict is
//! always reachable: return the strongest one the marks already force — `Invalid`
//! once no completion of the open questions can satisfy the question,
//! `Valid`/`Consistent` once none can break it, `Pending`/`Neutral` only while the
//! outcome is genuinely open. Deduce prunes and propagates; it does not own
//! validity — a deduce rule's validity-style check is *applying* this authority,
//! and its self-elimination of a question's own options must never outrun this
//! verdict.
//!
//! Precondition — the puzzle is **well-formed**. Structural nonsense is
//! `check_form`'s to reject, e.g. an option naming a question that doesn't
//! exist or itself, or a NONE where the kind forbids one. Guards in this code
//! may panic on poorly formed puzzles; those sites are tagged
//! `Fatal check_form error.`

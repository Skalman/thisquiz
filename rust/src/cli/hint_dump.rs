//! `thisquiz hint-dump`: every hint the corpus can produce, one line each, for
//! diffing what players read across engine changes. Walks each puzzle's verify
//! solve and renders every deduction of every round (against that round's
//! pre-state) plus every lookahead refutation — the same paths `reference`
//! samples, dumped in full instead of one example per rule.

# Project conventions

## Vocabulary

- `docs/glossary.md` defines the domain terms — question, option, cell, answer,
  option value, mark, eliminate, force, claim, question type (kind), board.
  Use them precisely in code and comments; a *cell* is one question × option
  square, never a whole question.

## Code quality

- Run `pnpm lint` before finishing — it covers TS linting and type checking
- Run `cargo clippy` before finishing — it covers RS linting; `cargo check` for type checking
- Use `pnpm fmt` or `cargo fmt` to format code

## Git

- Use simple `git commit -m "message"` — no heredocs, no `$(cat <<EOF)`
- Commit one logical change at a time

## Architecture

- Puzzle engine + generator live in Rust (`rust/src/`), compiled to wasm
  via `wasm-pack` and loaded from `src/lib/wasm.ts`. Browser runtime uses
  wasm exclusively for check_answer / deduce / lookahead / solve / generate.
- `pnpm test` runs the Rust test suite (`cargo test --release`); TS code is
  covered by `pnpm lint` (type-checking) and the wasm boundary itself.
- All cargo commands run in the root dir, not in rust/
- Rust owns all question types, logic, and reasoning prose (deduce-rule,
  question, and option text). The frontend never models a `QuestionType`; it
  holds the compact blob plus rendered board text (`PuzzleHandle.renderBoard` →
  question prompt + option labels) and marks. UI/navigation framing may render
  frontend-side from structured wire data (e.g. hint `Look` → `hint.tryLooking`).
- TS engine survivors in `src/engine/`: `state.ts` (mark derivation),
  `types.ts` (Puzzle/marks types + letter helpers), `hint-types.ts` (hint wire
  types).
- Puzzle data in `public/puzzles/daily/<year>.json` (compact form, parsed
  by wasm; the frontend hands the blob to Rust rather than expanding it).
- Year JSON missing or doesn't contain the date → wasm generates on the
  fly in `src/puzzles/daily.ts::fetchDaily`.
- All UI strings in src/i18n/ (English only for now)
- The guided tutorial (`src/puzzles/tutorial.ts`) is the one place the frontend
  scripts puzzle reasoning: its puzzles are fixed and tiny, so its copy is
  hand-written in i18n. Board text still comes from Rust.
